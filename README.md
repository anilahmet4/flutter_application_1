# Finance Asisstant App

## Overview
The Finance Asisstant App is designed to simplify personal finance management by automating the tracking of expenses through receipt scanning. Users can effortlessly keep tabs on their spending by taking a picture of their receipts, after which the app scans the text to extract essential details about each transaction. Currently, the app focuses on extracting the total price and the date of the transaction from the receipts. Future iterations will introduce more sophisticated features, including item categorization and comprehensive spending analysis, to provide users with deeper insights into their financial habits.
